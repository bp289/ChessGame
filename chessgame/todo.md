## TODO list:

1. Pins, if a piece is pinning you to the king, we should know.
2. Now that we know make sure pinned pieces cant move.
3. Checkmate, if there are no valid places for the king to move to, end the game.
4. Stalemate, if there are no valid places for the king to move to, but you are not in check, end the game as a stalemate rather than a checkmate.
5. Allow Castling, when the king or rook has not been moved and they see each other, allow castling.
6. Implement Castling, now that we are allowed to castle, give the player the option to do it.
7. Promotions, when we move a piece to the end of the board, allow promotions, player can change to a specific peice to promote to.
8. En passant, implement en passant move.
